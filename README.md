# QuantumCourse
Notebooks and other stuff for a Quantum Course

This repository contains the materials of the course about Introduction to Quantum Programming that I teach under demand. Please, feel free to send me any comments or corrections so I can improve them. You can use them freely on your own courses (Please, try to cite them!)

These notebooks are based on [ProjetQ](http://projectq.ch) and need the next Python packages installed:

    *numpy
    *CIL

It includes a set of Notebooks to learn some basics about Quantum Programming, with implementations of modern algorithms. Many of them are based on examples comming from ProjectQ and other sites or from publications. In each notebook, the references to the paper or to the original programs are included when needed.
